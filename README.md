# What is Neural Network
        A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a
        set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. 
        Neural networks can adapt to changing input; so the network generates the best possible result 
        without needing to redesign the output criteria.
